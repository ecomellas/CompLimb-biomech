
CompLimb code is a computational tool developed by Ester Comellas in Northeastern University (Boston, 2019) to elucidate the mechanobiological regulation of limb development. It is based on the biphasic nonlinear poro-viscoelastic formulation developed by Ester  Comellas and Jean-Paul Pelteret in the University of Erlangen-Nuremberg (Erlangen, 2016-2018) to reproduce brain tissue behaviour in response to biomechanical loading.
